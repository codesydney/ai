       "Compare and contrast the their major assets and liabilities in 2021\n",
       "\n",
       "## Answer:\n",
       "In terms of major assets in 2021, both Uber and Lyft had significant cash and investment holdings, reflecting their strong liquidity positions. However, Uber's cash reserves ($4.3 billion) and investments ($11.8 billion) were substantially larger than Lyft's cash ($457.3 million) and short-term investments ($1.8 billion). This difference highlights Uber's larger scale and financial resources.\n",
       "\n",
       "Uber also had substantial goodwill ($8.4 billion) and intangible assets ($2.4 billion) from acquisitions, while Lyft's goodwill ($180.5 million) and intangibles ($50.8 million) were relatively smaller. This suggests that Uber has been more acquisitive and has a larger acquired business value on its balance sheet.\n",
       "\n",
       "Both companies had significant property and equipment assets related to their operations, as well as right-of-use assets for leased facilities. However, Uber's property and equipment ($1.9 billion) and lease assets ($1.4 billion) were larger than Lyft's ($298.2 million and $223.4 million, respectively), again reflecting Uber's larger scale.\n",
       "\n",
       "Regarding major liabilities, both companies had substantial accrued liabilities, insurance reserves, and lease obligations. However, Uber's accrued liabilities ($6.5 billion) and long-term debt ($9.3 billion) were significantly higher than Lyft's accrued liabilities ($1.2 billion) and long-term debt ($655.2 million). This difference in debt levels could be attributed to Uber's larger size and more capital-intensive operations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lyft's insurance reserves ($1.1 billion) were a larger portion of its total liabilities compared to Uber's insurance reserves ($2.5 billion), which could be due to differences in their respective insurance policies and risk profiles.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, while both companies had similar categories of major assets and liabilities, Uber's figures were generally larger, reflecting its broader global operations and more extensive acquisitions compared to Lyft's primarily North American presence.\n"
