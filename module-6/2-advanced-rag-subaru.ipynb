       "The Subaru Outback offers slightly more cargo space than the Forester. With the rear seats up, the Outback has 522 liters of space compared to 498 liters in the Forester. When the rear seats are folded down, the Outback provides 1,267 liters of space, while the Forester offers 1,060 liters.

       "The Outback offers a larger cargo capacity of 522L compared to the Forester's 498L with the rear seats up. Additionally, the Outback's flat cargo area and convenient features like pull-out tie-down points, a 12V power supply, and a hands-free powered rear tailgate make it easier to load and secure gear. The integrated roof rails on certain Outback models also provide additional storage space for bulky items.\n",
